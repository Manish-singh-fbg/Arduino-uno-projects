Install arduino from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

A good place to start is the Arduino IDE's Library Manager:

Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...
In the "Filter your search..." box, type some keywords you have gleaned from the missing file name.
Scroll through the results for the right library. Click on it.
Click "Install".
Wait for installation to finish.
Click "Close".
Try compiling your code again.
